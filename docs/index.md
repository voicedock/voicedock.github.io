# VoiceDock â€” a platform for creating voice assistants

Many scientists and researchers create interesting models, but they are difficult to apply in real projects.
Firstly, all models have a different API, and secondly,
there may not be an API or the project may be difficult to launch.

VoiceDock solves these problems by providing a [universal API specification](specs/index.md)
and ready-to-use [applications](apps/index.md).

## An example of using VoiceDock

## What is this project for?
Now, AI technologies are available only to large corporations and researchers.
Ordinary developers have access to either cloud-based APIs or difficult-to-scalable solutions.

VoiceDock mission:

* Unify API access to AI models
* Provide ready-made implementations that can be easily run on a server in docker
* Create a voice assistant based on this base, launched locally and comparable in quality to the products of large corporations
